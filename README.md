## üìù Description
HumanForYou, a pharmaceutical company based in India with a workforce of approximately 4000 employees, has an issue where its annual empolyees turnover rate is about 15%, causing delays in projects, HR resource strain and inefficiencies in onboarding.

Project goal:
- Objective: Analyze data to identify influencing employee turnover.
- Task: Propose machine learning models to uncover insights and suggest improvements to motivate employees to stay.

## ‚è≥ Dataset
- Download the dataset files from this link: https://github.com/FlammeTik/AI_HR_Attrition/tree/d1f1f5312798d7126a1066c1f0494d3ed5b44d7d/Dataset

## :hammer_and_wrench: Requirements
* Python 3.5+
* Jupyter Notebook

## :mag: Data Pre-processing
* Created a feature called AVG_Work_Time.
* Removed non-related columns for my study like: EmployeeCount, EmployeeID, Gender, MaritalStatus, Over18 (all had the same value "Yes") & StandardHours (all had the same value "8").
* Applied custom mapping on these 2 categorical columns: Attrition & BusinessTravel. Here is the Attrition Destribution:

* Used OneHotEncoder on these 3 categorical columns: Department, EducationField & JobRole.
* Filled missing values using mean strategy.
* Created boxplots for each column to check for outliers. Here is a box plot for Monthly Income column:

* Ploted histograms for each column to see if the data is balanced or not:

* Ploted heat map for correlation matrix:

* Applied the standard scaler since there were outliers within the data.
* Created the data pipeline encompassing all transformation steps for later use in machine learning.

## :desktop_computer:	Machine Learning
* I applied the previous data pipeline.
* Utilizing StratifiedShuffleSplit, I partitioned the data into two sets: 80% designated for training and 20% allocated for testing, ensuring representative stratification across the dataset.
* Employed five distinct classification models, systematically assessing for overfitting through cross-validation techniques. Subsequently, I computed various evaluation metrics for each model and discerned the optimal choice based on the precision score.

* Conducted hyper-parameter tuning for Random Forest Classifier, meticulously exploring various settings to ascertain the most effective combination for optimal performance.

* Tested the final model on the test set and got excellent results:

## üéØ Recommendations
* I tweaked the top 5 contributing features' values:
  - AVG_Work_Time: capped at 8 Hours (turnover count: 711 -> 703).
  - Age: increased it by 10 years (turnover count: 711 -> 633).
  - TotalWorkingYears: increased it by 5 years (turnover count: 711 -> 686).
  - MonthlyIncome: increased it by 20.000 Indian Rupees that's $240 "March 2024" (turnover count: 711 -> 695).
  - YearsAtCompany: increased it by 10 years (turnover count: 711 -> 684).
  - ALL combined turnover count went from 711 to 119.

* Here some recommendations to reduce turnover rate:
  - Avoid crunch time at any cost.
  - Consider offering flexible working hours to further support employee well-being and retention.
  - Communicate transparently with employees about the reasons behind the adjustment in working hours.
  - Gather feedback from employees to understand how the adjusted working hours have impacted their satisfaction.
  - Prioritize retention efforts for younger employees to mitigate turnover risks.
  - Develop robust onboarding and career advancement programs for early-career professionals.
  - Cultivate a supportive work environment that addresses the needs and aspirations of younger talent.
  - Strengthen onboarding programs to effectively integrate new employees into the company culture and workflows, fostering a sense of belonging and commitment from the outset.
  - Develop comprehensive career pathing initiatives that provide clear trajectories for professional growth and advancement within the organization. This can incentivize employees to stay long-term by offering opportunities for skill development and career progression.
  - Implement mentorship programs to provide guidance and support to employees at various stages of their careers. Pairing less experienced employees with seasoned mentors can offer valuable insights, facilitate knowledge transfer, and enhance job satisfaction, thereby reducing turnover rates.
  - Review and adjust compensation structures to ensure they remain competitive within the industry and region, aiming to attract and retain top talent.
  - Offer additional benefits and perks aligned with employee preferences and needs, such as healthcare coverage, retirement plans, and wellness programs, to enhance overall job satisfaction and loyalty.
  - Conduct regular salary benchmarking exercises to stay informed about market trends and adjust compensation packages accordingly to retain valuable employees.
  - Strengthen onboarding processes to seamlessly integrate new employees into the company culture and workflow.
  - Implement initiatives to engage and support new hires during their initial months with the company.
  - Proactively address any challenges or concerns faced by new employees to enhance their experience and retention.

## üî® Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates the profound impact of adjusting key factors on turnover rates. By reducing average worked time, increasing age, total working years, and tenure, turnover rate decreased significantly from about 16% to nearly 3%. This underscores the importance of tailored retention strategies focusing on employee engagement and career development. Moving forward, continuous evaluation and adaptation of these strategies are crucial for sustaining employee retention and organizational success.
